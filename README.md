## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im Braden, a first year CS major at Georgia Tech interested in AI and Cybersecurity, plus trading stocks with robots:)

Im learning web development right now, just to dip my feet back into project development, but I also know OOP in Java and a good bit of python

Im looking to collaborate on any projects someone may need help on. And I am open to just learn. Please contact me if you need an extra hand on anything!
